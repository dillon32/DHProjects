The following program uses Google's TensorFlow machine learning API
to create a RNN that will autogenerate poetry after being fed a
line of text.

Both literary critics and programmers are faced with a problem
of describing the nature of poetry. The goal of writing this script
and testing it with poetry by a confessional poet such as
Sylvia Plath is to research underlying assumptions and definitions
of poetry, authorship, and language implicit in machine-generated
writing.

"loveSong.txt" is the input text that the RNN uses as a base to
train itself to autogenerate text. "loveSong.txt" may be replaced
with another poem other than Plath's "Love Song."

To conclude, TensorFlow's algorithm proved to work with certain poetic
genres, but not others, thus offering data that can be interpreted
to understand how TensorFlow theorizes lyric poetry. The script
could be developed further in order to account for rhythm and form.
Here the digital humanities would be helpful in foregrounding the
theory that produces poetic form and said theory's limits.
