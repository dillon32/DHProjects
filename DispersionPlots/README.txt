The following program dispersionPlot.R allows
a user to input four words at a time (with an
interest in comparing data) to produce
a respective amount of dispersion plots
searching for target words through a text.

The text file must first be cleaned up,
which is completed here with a Python script.
Data clean-up will differ from text to text
and is tailored to a text file
Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales"

Example dispersion plots are found in the
zipped folder, which I used to write
an argument on medieval representations
on literacy in "The Canterbury Tales."
